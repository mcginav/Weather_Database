# Weather_Database
## Added the weather description to the weather data. Created input statements to filter the data for weather preferences, which were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities were selected to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
